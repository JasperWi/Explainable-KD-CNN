# Explainable-KD-CNN

This repository contains the code for my bachelor thesis, focusing on evaluating the influence of knowledge distillation on the explainability of convolutional neural networks for image classification tasks.

Welcome to the Explainable-KD-CNN repository! Here, you'll find the implementation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks, along with the evaluation of their explainability using knowledge distillation techniques.

## Installation

To use the scripts in this repository, you'll need Python installed on your system. This repository uses Conda for managing dependencies. You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
conda install --file requirements.txt
```
